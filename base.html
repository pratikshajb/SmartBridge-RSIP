<p style="color:black;font-size:20px;"> <b> Sentiment analysis  â€“ otherwise known as opinion mining, in essence, 
it is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a series of words,
 used to gain an understanding of the the attitudes, 
 opinions and emotions expressed within an online mention. 
 Sentiment analysis is extremely useful in social media monitoring as it allows us to gain an overview of
  the wider public opinion behind certain topics. 
  It can also be an essential part of your market research and customer service approach. 
  Not only can you see what people think of your own products or services, 
  you can see what they think about your competitors too.  
  The overall customer experience of your users can be revealed quickly with sentiment analysis,
   but it can get far more granular too. </b> </p>
